#### **Introduction:**
This dataset contains coffee sales data over 2 years in Saudi Arabia, covering purchases from 100 customers across 5 different coffee Bean types. It includes details on quantity, pricing, discounts, and total sales, making it ideal for analyzing purchase trends, price impact, and market behavior.

#### **Conclusion:**

The sales data reveals several key trends and performance insights:

2. **Geographical Performance:** Sales in **Hail** and **Jeddah** were notably higher compared to other regions, suggesting stronger demand or more effective marketing in those cities.
3. **Discount Impact:** High discounts on Colombian coffee did not seem to negatively affect its sales, indicating that discounts may boost sales but should be monitored for profitability.
4. **Year-over-Year Growth:** A modest YOYTD sales increase of **1.07%** suggests steady, but slow growth, possibly due to market saturation or seasonal fluctuations.

#### **Recommendations:**

1. **Focus on High-Selling Products:** Continue to promote **Colombian** and **Costa Rica** coffees, as they have shown strong sales performance. Consider introducing new flavors or packaging to further boost sales.
2. **Regional Marketing Strategy:** Given that **Hail** and **Jeddah** are top-performing cities, targeted marketing efforts, loyalty programs, and promotional campaigns should be prioritized in these areas. Expand outreach to **Tabuk**, where sales are currently lower.
3. **Optimize Discount Strategies:** While discounts are effective for driving sales, especially on Colombian coffee, it is important to ensure that the discount strategy doesn't erode margins excessively. Adjust discount levels based on the performance of each product.
4. **Increase Forecast Accuracy:** Regularly update the forecasting model based on seasonal data and market shifts to improve revenue predictions. Consider adding external factors, such as market trends and consumer behavior changes, to refine forecasts further.
5. **Explore Underperforming Products and Regions:** Reevaluate marketing and sales efforts for products like **Brazilian** and regions like **Abha**, which have been underperforming.

With these insights and recommendations, the company should be able to tailor its strategies to maximize revenue, optimize product offerings, and improve market penetration.
